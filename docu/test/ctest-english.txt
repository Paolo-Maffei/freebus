Small C Test:

Be fair and don't use a compiler for this test. This test was not created to give svn
access only to advanced people it more the try to make you clear were you have some
weaknesses and were you should improve yourself.
It is allowed to use a calculator to help with hex calculation but it shouldn't be
necessary.

1. What is the value of variable var and test?
int test=5;
int var;

var=test++;

2. Why should the syntax of question 1 be avoided?

3. What does that line?
timerRunning &= ~(1<<i);

4. What does that line?
portValue |= (1<<i);

5. Explain when DEBUG_PUTC is executed.
if(timerRunning & (1<<i))
    DEBUG_PUTC('B');

6. What is displayed (function print displays argument on screen):
if(1<5)
print("Ziffer eins\n");
print("Ziffer zwei\n");

7. What is the value of temp?
initialPortValue=0xEF;
i=2;
temp=(initialPortValue>>(i*2))&0x03;

8. With what types/values is the function called?
write_eeprom_block(0x0000,1,&portValue);

9. What is wrong here and what would the function do if it where right?
#define RELOAD_APPLICATION_TIMER() {
          TCCR1A=0;                                                     \
          TCCR1B=(1<<WGM12)|(1<<CS11)|(1<<CS10);                        \
          OCR1A=16249;                                                  \
          currentTime=0;                                                \
          TCNT1=0;                                                      \
     }

10. Why we use such defines and when you should not use them?

11. What are the call values of the function?
i=1;
portValue=0xF1;
sendRespondTelegram(i,(portValue & (1<<i))?1:0);

12. What is the size of the array and give the boundary of it (uint8_t is 8 Bit)?
static uint8_t eeprom_cache[299];

13. When you use the variable declaration suffix static?
static uint8_t test;

14. What is a prototype in C?

15. When you set the prototype in a .h and when in a .c file?
